# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description

The goal was to develop a page that displayed the current date and allowed the user to input and save events for the current day. The saved events should still display when the page is relaoded. Time blocks should also be color coded depending on if they are before, after or at the current time.

## Live Deployment link

The live deployment of the site can be found at: https://pletzjd.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

## Usage

The user can click on the center box of the grid to type in an event they want to save to their calender. Clicking the save button saves the input to local storage. This is used to re-display the event if the calendar is closed and reopened or the page is reloaded. Each row of the calender is color coded for if that time-block is in before the current time (grey) after the current time (green) or is the current time (red). The top header displays the current date.
